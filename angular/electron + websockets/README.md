ReadMe â€“ Electron + Node + SignalR + Angular (2016)
==============================

I've included a partial version of the Auckland Museum project which used SignalR to communicate between two devices.

The project uses electron to serve a node app with signalR listeners running.

As the user navigates around the app, app controllers emit state changes via a basic service.
